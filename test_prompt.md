You will receive a short analytic text.  
Task: break it into a set of numbered arguments, then output ONLY a JSON array.  
For each argument produce:

• "id": a unique label (e.g. "A1", "A2" …).  
• "evidence": an array.  Quote direct evidence as plain strings.  
  If a deduction from an earlier argument is used as evidence, reference it like  
    { "argument": "<earlier-id>", "source": "deduction" }.  
• "deduction": the analytic conclusion drawn from the evidence.  
• "likelihood": include ONLY if the source text assigns one, and use exactly one of  
  the following terms (case-sensitive):  
  "Remote Chance", "Highly Unlikely", "Unlikely",  
  "Realistic Possibility", "Likely or Probable",  
  "Highly Likely", "Almost Certain".

Return nothing but the JSON.

Example structure:
[
  {
    "id": "A1",
    "evidence": ["fact …", "fact …"],
    "deduction": "…"
  },
  {
    "id": "A2",
    "evidence": [
      { "argument": "A1", "source": "deduction" },
      "additional fact …"
    ],
    "deduction": "…",
    "likelihood": "Unlikely"
  }
]

Now apply these rules to the following text:
