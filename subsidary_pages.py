            ## ‚ùì Why use Evidence Network Builder
            Complex analysis of probabilistic events is complicated... Whilst analysts are good at estimating probabilities over small, well understood domains, they perform badly over large ones. Moreover, they rarely an intuitive understanding of how probabilistic causal events affect eachother. Finally, using structured analytic techniques have been key to winning superforecasting teams.

            So... why not use a tool that takes your analysis, breaks it down into a set of small domains that you are good at estimating, links those domains to your hypothesis (and uses MATHS to calculate their probabilities), and enforces a structured analytical technique!             

            ## üß† How to use Evidence Network Builder

            **Build, explore & export networks of evidence and hypotheses.**

            1. **Import**  
            Paste your narrative or upload a JSON to auto-extract nodes via GPT, or add/edit nodes and edges manually.

            2. **Quantify**  
            Assign qualitative **priors** to hypotheses, rate **evidence reliability**, and set **edge strength** multipliers.

            3. **Analyze**  
            View calculated probabilities, truth-tables by component, and an interactive network graph.

            4. **Export**  
            Download your full network (with priors, truth-probs & weights) as JSON.

            Analysts frequently encounter difficulties in accurately predicting probabilistic events due to inherent cognitive limitations and reliance on heuristic reasoning. This paper examines three interrelated factors contributing to these challenges: (1) varying predictive accuracy in small versus large domains, (2) intuitive human probability reasoning and associated systematic biases, and (3) the role and effectiveness of Structured Analytical Techniques (SATs) in addressing these biases. While humans can perform effectively in constrained environments with clear and frequent feedback, their ability to predict outcomes deteriorates significantly in complex, ambiguous contexts. SATs provide structured methods that aim to mitigate judgmental errors but require thoughtful implementation and organizational support.
